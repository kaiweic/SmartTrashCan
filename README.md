This is a Hackathon project that can sort the trash into its own category: Recyclable, Compost, Landfill.  When trash is being placed in our trash sorter (built by Arduino), we leveraged Clarifai CV to identify the trash so our code can determine which bin to throw into.

In addition, we built a UI which can detect and visualize the trash cans that are full using a heat map.  This is mainly for management purposes to determine which workspace is being used more frequently.

A great bonus we have is an Android app that can take images of trash and identify to users what category the trash belongs to!
